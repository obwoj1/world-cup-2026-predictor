"""Current FIFA men's world ranking (June 2026) for the 48 finalists.

Source: FIFA via ESPN top-50 (https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46664763) and
whereig.com for positions below 50, fetched 2026-06-13. Kept separate from Elo because
the two systems disagree (notably Morocco: FIFA #7 vs Elo #23). The prediction model uses
Elo (more predictive); FIFA rank is shown alongside for context.
